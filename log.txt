- Started planning our approach on proving hypothesis â€œRelative to the size of the dataset, binary search is faster than linear search."
- Would use currentTimeMillis to serve as a "timestamp" at the beginning and end of each search. 
- We would subtract the beginning and end times to get the duration of the search. 
- Discussed where we would place these timestamps in order to get the most accurate data
  - Populate array prior to timestamp, as we want to measure time for ONLY the search
- Would use currentTimeMillis in the main method of the Driver file, as we want to measure the real time for each method invokation rather than time for each iteration.

- After reviewing issues on our plan and feedback from Mr.Mykolyk, we realized we needed to continue expanding our arrays since our hypothesis is relative to size. - We can do this by using _size and expand() that we implemented in SuperArray. UPDATE: We opted not to.
- Originally thought we would repeat runs of each search method around only 10 times. However, Java has a lot of computing power and our total time for every search should take a few minutes or so. 
- Therefore, we should repeat and time each search 100 or more times.

- We created an initial test of searching within one individual array, with an intent to later expand these tests into multiple arrays.
- This serves as an initial proof of concept.

- Initial test had 1 million elements, took around 8 minutes to complete LinSearch, only around a 100ms for BinSearch.
- We expanded into three test cases, starting with 200 thousand elements and increasing by 200 thousand each time. 
- We stored our times for each search in two long arrays. These were initalized to have 3 indexes to hold the 3 tests we have so far. May be modified later.
- We saw that, relative to the size of the array of Integers, times for linSearch seemed to have an exponential trend upwards.

- We added the average elapsed time for each search (binary and linear) within each array.
- We added a print statement comparing how many times faster binary search was compared to linear search in each array.
- Eliminated some clutter in the code.

- We added a search for a value outside of a dataset (worst case) and updated the Results in the Readme.md accordingly.
- Revised the plan so it accurately reflects what we did.
- Added more to gallery tour.
