- Started planning our approach on proving hypothesis "â€œRelative to the size of the dataset, binary search is faster than linear search."
- Would use TimeMillis to serve as a "timestamp" at the beginning and end of each search. 
- We would subtract the beginning and end times to get the duration of the search. 
- Discussed where we would place these timestamps in order to get the most accurate data
  - Populate array prior to timestamp, as we want to measure time for ONLY the search
- Would use TimeMillis in the main method of the Driver file, as we want to measure the real time for each method invokation rather than time for each iteration.

- After reviewing issues on our plan and feedback from Mr.Mykolyk, we realized we needed to continue expanding our arrays since our hypothesis is relative to size. - We can do this by using _size and expand() that we implemented in SuperArray.
- Originally thought we would repeat runs of each search method around only 10 times. However, Java has a lot of computing power and our total time for every search should take a few minutes or so. 
- Therefore, we should repeat and time each search 100 or more times.

- We created an initial test of searching within one individual array, with an intent to later expand these tests into multiple arrays.
- This serves as an initial proof of concept.
