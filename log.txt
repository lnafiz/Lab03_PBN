- Started planning our approach on proving hypothesis "â€œRelative to the size of the dataset, binary search is faster than linear search."
- Would use TimeMillis to serve as a "timestamp" at the beginning and end of each search. 
- We would subtract the beginning and end times to get the duration of the search. 
- Discussed where we would place these timestamps in order to get the most accurate data
  - Populate array prior to timestamp, as we want to measure time for ONLY the search
- Would use TimeMillis in the main method of the Driver file, as we want to measure the real time for each method invokation rather than time for each iteration.
