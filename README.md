### Tests Performed
In our main method in the SearchDriver.java file, we created 5 long arrays:

- 3 of the arrays are test arrays for our search methods, each with varying indices. The test arrays have 200k, 400k, and 600k indices each containing a value.
- The other 2 arrays store the time it took each method to search for a certain value within each of our 3 test arrays. The time storing arrays have 3 indices, each one storing the time it took the search method to find a value within one of the test arrays.

We then averaged the times in the 2 arrays that stored times and displayed them to show the results of our experiment.
