### Tests Performed
In our main method in the SearchDriver.java file, we created 5 long arrays:

- 3 of the arrays are test arrays for our search methods, each with varying indices. The test arrays have 200k, 400k, and 600k indices each containing a value.
- The other 2 arrays store the time it took each method to search for a certain value within each of our 3 test arrays. The time storing arrays have 3 indices, each one storing the time it took the search method to find a value within one of the test arrays.

The times stored represent the total time it took to search for every value within each test array, so we then averaged the times in the 2 arrays and displayed them to show the results of our experiment. The average time represents how long it took the search method to find each value within the test array.
