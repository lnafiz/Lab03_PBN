0. In the SearchDriver.java file, we will seek to do three things: 
- Record elapsed time by implementing the currentTimeMillis() method.
- Create long arrays storing datasets and times.
- Calculate average time per search (binary/linear).

1. Move the tests from the main methods in LinSearch.java and BinSearch.java to SearchDriver.java.

2. The first thing in the main method should be initializations of three long arrays, to be searched via linear and binary search individually.

3. Remove any System.out.println statements (they add unnecessary time to the actual search methods).

4. Generate test arrays to use search methods on, some with random elements, others as "worst" or "best" scenarios.

5. Record start time right before each search method is called in a test in the main method.

6. Store this time in an index of one of the long arrays generated, depending on which search method you just tested.

7. Implement time recording method again right after each search method is called in a test in the main method.

8. Repeat 5-8 at least 10 times for each search method, to generate as much times as possible.

9. After data has been collected, subtract begin times from end times to get time it took to implement the search methods. 

10. Cauculate average time using average method in order to get a rough estimate of the time it takes to perform each search method.
- The method with the lowest average time is the fastest.
