0. Import java.lang.System in SearchDriver.java to gather necessary time-recording tools. 

1. In the same file, create three methods. 
- The first method will record time by implementing the currentTimeMillis() method.
- The second method will create a long array.
- The third method will calculate averages.

2. Move the tests from the main methods in LinSearch.java and BinSearch.java to SearchDriver.java.

3. The first thing in the main method should be initializations of two long arrays, one for each type of search.
- Exact indices needed is not clear at the moment, but should have at least 20.

4. Remove any System.out.println statements (they add unnecessary time to the actual search methods).

5. Generate test arrays to use search methods on, some with random elements, others as "worst" or "best" scenarios.

6. Implement time recording method right before each search method is called in a test in the main method.

7. Store this time in an index of one of the long arrays generated, depending on which search method you just tested.

8. Implement time recording method again right after each search method is called in a test in the main method.

9. Store this time in the next index of the same long array, making sure that beginTime and endTime are next to each other.

10. Repeat 5-8 at least 10 times for each search method, to generate as much times as possible.

11. After data has been collected, subtract begin times from end times to get time it took to implement the search methods. 

12. Cauculate average time using average method in order to get a rough estimate of the time it takes to perform each search method.
- The method with the lowest average time is the fastest.
