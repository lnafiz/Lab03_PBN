DISCO:
- You can use currentTimeMillis() to get the current time as a long value.

QCC:
- Why does TimeMillis use midnight January 1st, 1970 as the standard for time computation?

DISCO:
- Our array should be expanding as we test the search methods.
- We need a lot of repititions for testing (>= 100 times).
- We can store times in arrays and compute from there rather than waste time with SOPs.

QCC:
- What errors come up from method currentTimeMillis()?

DISCO:
- The search time when we test each index as a target in a one million item array was longer than we initially thought (~8mins), so we realized we needed to scale our tests down. 
- Floor division is still used when working with long values. 

QCC:
- How many test cases should we have while also having a reasonable run time?

Main takeaways:
- In smaller datasets (around 1-100), linear search appears to be faster than binary search.
- A possible worst case could be the target not being within the array.
- Other groups had a average binary search time of 0 ms, but we suspect that is due to not typecasting to double prior to the calculation.
- You can account for inital lag by running "throwaway" code first for meaningful measurements.
- Other groups chose their targets as specifically the worst case, random case, or simply processing every element in the array.
